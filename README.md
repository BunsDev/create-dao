# create-dao

## What this is supposed to be

`npx create-dao`

The way [Nader](https://discord.com/channels/883478451850473483/883705562850807808/910908371446673408) sees it:

1. A smart contract that deploys an NFT or ERC20 (or have contracts for both)
2. A front end that describes how the dao works (info pages, etc...)
3. A guide that is built into the README that describes how to token-gate a discord, and the various tradeoffs around decisions when setting up a DAO
4. A user interface that allows members to buy or mint tokens
